\begin{agradecimentos}
    To my family, especially my parents, for all 
    the support and encouragement throughout not 
    only my undergraduate studies but also throughout 
    the entire journey up to this moment.
    \\\\
    To my supervisor, Flávio Codeço Coelho, for being 
    my guide in the development of this work and for 
    introducing me to the field of modeling biological phenomena.
    \\\\
    To all the professors I had the opportunity to 
    meet and from whom I had the pleasure of learning 
    during my undergraduate studies, and to the teaching assistants who were willing to help in the most challenging moments.
    \\\\
    Finally, I would like to express my gratitude to 
    all my friends who accompanied and supported me 
    until now. The last 4 years wouldn't have been the same without you.
