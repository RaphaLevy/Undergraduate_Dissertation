\chapter{Metodology}

For the elaboration of the work, population data from the 
Trajetórias Project dataset and climatic data from the Climate 
Data will be used. Methods of disease transmission based on ordinary 
differential equations, such as the SIR model, will be addressed. 
Starting with a simple modeling approach, environmental phenomena 
such as deforestation and burning will be included to assess how 
modifications in the ecosystem will interfere with the previously 
developed model. Computational calculations were performed using 
the SageMath 9.2 environment, utilizing Scipy's numerical 
integration functions to solve the method.
\\\\
First I will be describing SIR \cite{githubMODBIO, Prasad2022}, 
which can be considered the foundation 
of the models that will be used throughout the project. 
Developed by W. O. Kermack and A. G. McKendrick in 1927, 
SIR is one of the most widely used models for epidemic 
modeling, considering three compartments:

\begin{align*}
    & S: \text{number of susceptible individuals} \\
    & I: \text{number of infected individuals} \\
    & R: \text{number of recovered individuals}
\end{align*}
\\
In this model, healthy individuals in the $S$ class are 
susceptible to contact with individuals in the $I$ class and 
are transferred to this compartment if they contract the disease. 
Infected individuals can spread the disease through 
direct contact with susceptible individuals, but they can 
also become immune over time and are transferred to the $R$ 
compartment. In general, $R$ includes the total of recovered (immune) 
individuals and those who died from the disease, but we can assume 
that the number of deaths is very low compared to the total 
population size and can be ignored. We also assume that individuals 
in this category will not revert to being susceptible or infectious.
\\\\
Considering an epidemic over a short period and 
that the disease is not fatal, we can ignore vital 
dynamics of birth and death. With this, we can describe 
the SIR model through the following system of ordinary 
differential equations (ODEs):

\begin{gather*}
\begin{cases}
\dfrac{dS}{dt} = -\dfrac{\beta SI}{N} \\
\\
\dfrac{dI}{dt} = \dfrac{\beta SI}{N} - \gamma I \\
\\
\dfrac{dR}{dt} = \gamma I
\end{cases}
\end{gather*}
\\
In the model, $N(t) = S(t) + I(t) + R(t)$, i.e., the total population 
at time $t$, while $\beta$ is the infection rate, and $\gamma$ is the
recovery rate. Given that $S + I + R$ is always constant if we 
ignore birth and death, we have 
$\dfrac{dS}{dt} + \dfrac{dI}{dt} + \dfrac{dR}{dt} = 0$.
\\\\
For the disease to spread, it is easy to see that 
$\dfrac{dI}{dt} = \dfrac{\beta SI}{N} - \gamma I > 0$. 
Thus, $\dfrac{\beta SI}{N} > \gamma I \Rightarrow \dfrac{\beta S}{N} > \gamma$. 
Assuming we are at the beginning of the infection, given 
that we want to observe its spread, $I$ will be very small, 
and $S \approx N$. We then conclude that 
$\dfrac{\beta N}{N} > \gamma \Rightarrow \dfrac{\beta}{\gamma} > 1$. 
This dimensionless value can be derived by nondimensionalizing 
the model: 
let $y^* = \dfrac{S}{N}$, $x^* = \dfrac{I}{N}$, $z^* = \dfrac{R}{N}$, 
and $t^* = \dfrac{t}{1/\gamma} = \gamma t$, so that $y^* + x^* + z^* = 1$. 
Substituting the system of ODEs above using these values:


\begin{gather*}
\begin{cases}
\dfrac{dS}{dt} = \dfrac{d(y^*N)}{d(t^*/\gamma)} = -\dfrac{\beta SI}{N} = -\dfrac{\beta(y^*N)(x^*N)}{N} = -\beta y^*Nx^* \\
\\
\dfrac{dI}{dt} = \dfrac{d(x^*N)}{d(t^*/\gamma)} = \dfrac{\beta SI}{N} - \gamma I = \dfrac{\beta(y^*N)(x^*N)}{N} -\gamma(x^*N) = \beta y^*Nx^* - \gamma x^*N \\
\\
\dfrac{dR}{dt} = \dfrac{d(z^*N)}{d(t^*/\gamma)} = \gamma I = \gamma(x^*N)
\end{cases}
\end{gather*}

Now, canceling the factors $N$ and $\gamma$ on both sides of the equations:

\begin{gather*}
\begin{cases}
\dfrac{d(y^*)}{d(t^*)} = -\dfrac{\beta y^*x^*}{\gamma} \\
\\
\dfrac{d(x^*)}{d(t^*)} = \dfrac{\beta y^*x^*}{\gamma} - x^* \\
\\
\dfrac{d(z^*)}{d(t^*)} = x^*
\end{cases}
\end{gather*}
\\
Thus, we have a system given only by $y^*$ and $x^*$ and the 
parameter $\dfrac{\beta}{\gamma}$, which we can call $R_0$.
\\\\
As this work will be primarily focused on malaria modeling, 
I will now present one of the first models developed specifically 
for this disease, by Sir Ronald Ross in 1911 \cite{Bacaër2011}, 
which uses two distinct ordinary differential equations (ODEs) 
different from those presented above:

\begin{gather*}
\begin{cases}
\dfrac{dI}{dt} = bp'i\dfrac{N-I}{N} -aI\\
\\
\dfrac{di}{dt} = bp(n-i)\dfrac{I}{N} - mI
\end{cases}
\end{gather*}
\\
In this case, $N$ is the total human population, $I(t)$ is the number 
of infected humans at time $t$, $n$ is the total mosquito population, 
$i(t)$ is the number of infected mosquitoes at time $t$, $b$ is the 
biting rate, $p$ is the probability of transmission from human to 
mosquito per bite, $p'$ is the probability of transmission from 
mosquito to human per bite, $a$ is the recovery rate of human infection, 
and $m$ is the mosquito mortality rate. $bp'ii\dfrac{N-I}{N}dt -aIdt$ 
represent, respectively, the number of new infected humans and 
the number of recovered humans in the interval $dt$, while 
$bp(n-i)\dfrac{I}{N}dt - mIdt$ represent, respectively, the 
number of new infected mosquitoes and the number of mosquitoes that 
die in that time interval, assuming that infection does not affect 
the mosquito mortality rate.
\\\\
For this model, Ross discussed two equilibrium points, where 
$\dfrac{dI}{dt} = \dfrac{di}{dt} = 0$. They occur when $I=i=0$, 
which is the case where there is no malaria, and, for $I, i > 0$, 
$I = N\dfrac{1-amN/(b^2pp'n)}{1+aN/(bp'n)}$ and 
$i = n\dfrac{1-amN/(b^2pp'n)}{1+m/(bp)}$. Furthermore, for the 
disease to establish itself, $n$ must be greater than a 
threshold value $n^* = \dfrac{amN}{b^2pp'}$. In this case, 
the disease becomes endemic. If $n<n^*$, the equilibrium will 
be at $I=i=0$, and the disease will disappear.
\\\\
Dividing the equations of the equilibrium points by $I \times i$, we have:

\begin{gather*}
\begin{cases}
\dfrac{bp}{N} = \dfrac{bpn}{Ni} -\dfrac{m}{I} \\
\\
\dfrac{bp'}{N} = \dfrac{bp'}{I} -\dfrac{a}{i} 
\end{cases}
\end{gather*}
\\
Which transforms the problem into a linear 
system with two unknowns, $I$ and $i$.
\\\\
Now, I will present the model that will be used 
for the development of the work, based on the one 
developed by Paul E. Parham and Edwin Michael in 
2010, which takes into account factors such as 
rainfall and temperature ($R$ and $T$, respectively) \cite{Parham2010}.
\\\\
Defining the equations that will be used:
\begin{gather*}
\begin{cases}
\dfrac{dS_H}{dt} = -ab_2\bigg(\dfrac{I_M}{N}\bigg)S_H\\
\\
\dfrac{dI_H}{dt} = ab_2\bigg(\dfrac{I_M}{N}\bigg)S_H-\gamma I_H\\
\\
\dfrac{dR_H}{dt} = \gamma I_H\\
\\
\dfrac{dS_M}{dt} = b - ab_1\bigg(\dfrac{I_H}{N}\bigg)S_M - \mu S_M\\
\\
\dfrac{dE_M}{dt} = ab_1\bigg(\dfrac{I_H}{N}\bigg)S_M - \mu E_M - ab_1\bigg(\dfrac{I_H}{N}\bigg)S_Ml(\tau_M)\\
\\
\dfrac{dI_M}{dt} = ab_1\bigg(\dfrac{I_H}{N}\bigg)S_Ml(\tau_M) -\mu I_M
\end{cases}
\end{gather*}
\\\\
It is necessary to mention that the original model 
used $I_M(t-\tau)$ in $\dfrac{dI_H}{dt}$ and $I_H(t-\tau)$ in 
$\dfrac{dE_M}{dt}$ (in the transition from $E$ to $I$) and 
$\dfrac{dI_M}{dt}$, respectively. However, as this would 
make the model based on delay differential equations, it was 
recommended by the advisor to disregard this difference and use 
only the current time $t$.
\\\\
Having the model equations for the human and mosquito 
populations, I will first define the parameters used in the modeling 
and other necessary functions, and then the variables used:

Parameters marked with $^*$ were added during the development of the modeling to correct 
inaccuracies derived from the original equations in the reference article.
The definition of $DD$ was taken from \cite{McCord2016} and \cite{10665-41724}.
\\\\
Having the equations and parameters, the modeling was initially done using data from the 
rural area of Manaus, in the period from 2004 to 2008, which were selected due to the 
higher incidence of malaria cases caused by $P. \ vivax$, 
the species responsible for the highest number of cases in Brazil 
\cite{OliveiraFerreira2010, 10.3389/fpubh.2021.647754}. Using the incidence 
function used in the Trajetorias project \cite{Rorato2023}, we have:
\begin{gather*}
    \text{Inc}(d, m, z, t_1, t_2) = \dfrac{\text{Cases}(d, m, z, t_1, t_2)}{\text{Pop}(m,z,(t_1+t_2)/2) \times 5 \ \text{years}} \times 10^5,
\end{gather*}
where $\text{Cases}(d, m, z, t_1, t_2)$ is the number of cases of disease $d$ in zone $z$ of municipality 
$m$, and $t_1$ and $t_2$ are the initial and final years of the interval, while 
$\text{Pop}(m,z,(t_1+t_2)/2) \times 5 \ \text{years}$ is the population in zone $z$ 
of municipality $m$ in the middle of the period multiplied by the total number 
of observation years. In this case, we could indicate as:
\begin{gather*}
    \footnotesize{\text{Inc}(\text{Vivax}, \text{Manaus}, \text{Rural}, 2004, 2008) = \dfrac{\text{Cases}(\text{Vivax}, \text{Manaus}, \text{Rural}, 2004, 2008)}{\text{Pop}(\text{Manaus}, \text{Rural}, 2006) \times 5 \ \text{years}} \times 10^5}  \\\\
    184030.8 = \dfrac{78745}{5\text{Pop}} \times 10^5 \Rightarrow Pop \approx 8558
\end{gather*}
Using data on the total population of Manaus in this period, 
with an incidence of 3106.4 and a number of cases of 262264, the 
total population of the municipality was estimated to be 1688540 
inhabitants. Thus, the rural population could be considered as 
approximately 0.5$\%$ of the municipality's population.
\\\\
Having estimated the percentage size of the rural population 
in the city, it was possible to calculate this population for 
each of the years of the analysis through linear interpolation 
using historical series data from IBGE \cite{popIBGE}:
\\\\

\end{tabular}
\captionof{table}{Manaus' rural population from 2004 to 2009}
\end{center}
\end{adjustwidth}

\vspace{1cm}
As there were population data for the years 2000, 2007, and 2010, 
interpolations were performed with different initial and final 
points, using data from 2000 to 2007 for 2004-2007 and from 2007 
to 2010 for 2008-2009, ensuring the correct use of the 2007 population.
\\\\
Now, describing a bit of the theory behind environmental factors, 
according to \cite{Norris2004}, the removal of tree canopies allowed 
the resurgence of malaria in South America. In deforested areas, 
without tree canopies covering the ground, water puddles under sunlight 
attract mosquitoes of the species $Anopheles \ darlingi$, the main vector 
related to human malaria in the Amazon \cite{infoAnopheles}. They are 
usually less commonly found in still intact forests. This is 
because light and heat favor the development of larvae and 
pupae, in addition to a greater availability of algae for 
larval feeding \cite{article_alteracoesambientais}. The increase 
in ambient temperature also favors the vectorial capacity of 
mosquitoes. Deforestation also attracts and brings humans closer 
to take part in logging, agriculture, and road construction 
activities, bringing individuals infected with $Plasmodium$ to 
an area where both the vector and the environment have already 
been modified to favor transmission. Furthermore, agriculture 
also promotes river sedimentation, providing suitable environments 
for breeding sites. Therefore, it can be considered a relevant 
change for the model to take into account deforestation, the 
increase in survival probabilities of eggs, larvae, and pupae, 
as well as increasing the proportion of bites that lead to infection, 
due to the increased human population density in areas near mosquito 
breeding sites.
